Brain and other nervous system cancer is the 10th leading cause of death for men and women. It is estimated that 18,600 adults (10,500 men and 8,100 women) will die from primary cancerous brain and CNS tumors this year. Application of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI)has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification. Hence, proposing a system performing detection and classification by using Deep Learning Algorithms using ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and TransferLearning (TL) would be helpful to doctors all around the world. Brain Tumors are complex. There are a lot of abnormalities in the sizes and location of the brain tumor(s). This makes it really difficult for completely understand the nature of the tumor. Also, a professional Neurosurgeon is required for MRI analysis. Oftentimes in developing countries the lack of skillful doctors and lack of knowledge about tumors makes it really challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRI’. So an automated system on Cloud can solve this problem. In this project, we propose a constructive solution for detecting and labeling infected brain tumor tissues in patients. We attempt to solve this by implementing a Convolutional neural network architecture model for on the go diagnosis. This aims to cut down the prognosis time by offering a smooth interface to doctors and clinicians by offering a smartphone app, and a WebApp, in which the doctor can simply upload the MRI image and get a clear diagnosis prediction. To cut down false positives our model is trained on 4 types of brain tumors :Glioma tumor, Meningioma tumor, Normal and Pituitary tumor brain MRI images to get the best possible results with highest accuracy. Our Idea implements a high accuracy ConvNet model while keeping the required computational power very low, making it to be easily accessible by simply pressing a button .
